Dear [Contact Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request access to a dataset of orthopantomogram (OPG) X-ray images for our research project on automated tooth detection and numbering.

### Project Overview

We have developed a proof-of-concept (POC) system called **Tooth-AI** that automatically detects and numbers teeth in OPG images using deep learning. Our system combines Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation and EfficientNet for tooth classification, achieving **85-90% FDI accuracy** on a publicly available dataset.

### Current Status

We have completed a comprehensive POC validation (see attached report) demonstrating:
- High accuracy on standard OPG images
- Fast inference suitable for clinical workflows
- Robust performance across various image qualities

However, our current dataset is limited (~250 images from Niha Adnan et al., 2024), and we seek to validate and improve our system on a larger, more diverse dataset representative of real clinical practice.

### Request Details

We are requesting access to **500-1000 de-identified OPG images** with the following characteristics:
- Diverse age ranges (pediatric, adult, geriatric)
- Various imaging systems
- Different clinical conditions (normal, restorations, implants, missing teeth)
- Standard OPG format (DICOM or PNG/JPEG)

### Compliance and Security

We understand the importance of patient privacy and data security. We have prepared comprehensive compliance documentation including:
- **IRB Checklist** (attached)
- **Data Security Policy** (attached)
- **Patient Privacy and De-identification Procedures** (attached)
- **Model Risk Assessment** (attached)

All data will be:
- Fully de-identified (no PHI)
- Encrypted at rest and in transit
- Used for research purposes only
- Stored on secure, access-controlled systems
- Retained only as per IRB approval

### Expected Outcomes

With access to a larger dataset, we plan to:
1. Validate model performance on diverse clinical data
2. Improve robustness to different imaging conditions
3. Develop missing tooth detection capabilities
4. Prepare for multi-center clinical validation
5. Publish results in peer-reviewed journals

We are committed to:
- Acknowledging your institution in publications
- Sharing research findings
- Collaborating on clinical validation
- Providing value back to the clinical community

### Attachments

1. **POC Performance Report** - Detailed validation results
2. **Data Access Request Document** - Complete request details
3. **IRB Checklist** - Compliance documentation
4. **Data Security Policy** - Security measures
5. **Partnership Guide** - Integration possibilities

### Next Steps

We would be grateful for the opportunity to:
1. Discuss this request in more detail
2. Address any questions or concerns
3. Provide additional information as needed
4. Explore potential collaboration opportunities

Please let me know if you would like to schedule a meeting to discuss this further. I am happy to provide any additional information or documentation you may need.

Thank you for considering our request. We look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
