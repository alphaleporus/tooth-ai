# Funding Summary: Tooth-AI Project

**Project:** Automated Tooth Detection and Numbering in Orthopantomogram X-rays  
**Status:** Proof of Concept Complete, Seeking Validation Funding  
**Date:** November 2024

---

## Funding Request Overview

**Total Requested:** $5,000 - $10,000  
**Duration:** 6-12 months  
**Purpose:** Dataset validation and model improvement

---

## Budget Breakdown

### 1. Compute Resources ($200-400)

**GPU Compute:**
- Cloud GPU instances (NVIDIA A100/V100)
- Estimated: 100-200 hours
- Cost: $2-4/hour
- **Subtotal:** $200-400

**Rationale:** Model retraining on expanded dataset requires significant GPU compute

### 2. Storage ($5-10)

**Data Storage:**
- Cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
- Estimated: 50-100 GB
- Cost: $0.10/GB/month
- **Subtotal:** $5-10

**Rationale:** Secure storage for dataset and model outputs

### 3. Expert Annotation ($2,000-5,000)

**Annotation Services:**
- Expert dental professional annotation
- Estimated: 50-100 hours @ $40-50/hour
- **Subtotal:** $2,000-5,000

**Rationale:** High-quality annotations required for validation (if external annotation needed)

**Note:** May be reduced if institutional annotation support available

### 4. Infrastructure ($500-1,000)

**On-Premise Infrastructure (if needed):**
- Storage server
- Network equipment
- **Subtotal:** $500-1,000

**Rationale:** Alternative to cloud storage if on-premise preferred

**Note:** May be $0 if using cloud-only approach

### 5. Publication Costs ($200-500)

**Open Access Fees:**
- Journal publication fees
- Conference registration
- **Subtotal:** $200-500

**Rationale:** Open-access publication for wider dissemination

### 6. Travel (Optional) ($500-1,000)

**Conference Travel:**
- Conference registration
- Travel and accommodation
- **Subtotal:** $500-1,000

**Rationale:** Present results at conferences (optional)
